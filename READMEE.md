## My process

Initially, I started with building mobile screen. I created different section in html document, then I put some child elements in it. Then I started
styling my html according to figma. Once I was done with mobile screen, I added media queries for tablet and desktop screens and changed some properties.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries


### What I learned

```html
<a href="#">Get Started</a>
```
```css
.bottombut:hover::before {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

Practice helps development, so I intend to practice CSS and HTML5 till I'm pro at it ^_^
